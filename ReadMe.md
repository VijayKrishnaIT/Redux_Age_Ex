# Architecture of ReactJS

## ReactJS Application

    - Sorting
    - Pagingation
    - Searching

## ACTIONS

    GETEMPLOYEES
    ADDEMPLOYEE
    UPDATEEMPLOYEE
    DELETEEMPLOYEE

## Thunk

    - thunk will monitor the 4 actions.

## Node Server

    - Node Server will connect with database.

## axios

    - communication between Action and Node Server.

## MongoDB Database

## Reducer

# React Applications Libraries needed

    > redux                 //redux architecture

    > react-redux           //integrate react-redux

    > redux-thunk           //monitor actions

    > axios                 // connect to server

    > @material-ui/core     //develop the rich ui

IQ

1. How to Monitor the Actions? Thunk

2. How to Manipulate the Actions? Saga

3. React, Redux, Thunk, Saga are heart of React.

4. If it is stateless component which Lifecycle method : ComponentDidMount

5. If it is stateful component which Lifecycle method: ComponentWillMount

6. No relation between Stateless and Stateful component.
